React's Component LifeCycle

-Mount: Is when the component gets added to the DOM
    - 1st Render


-Update: Re-render
    - setState functions trigger re-renders


-UnMount: When the compenent is removed from the DOM


useEffect: is how we handle side effects
- API call when you first load a compenent to grab all user data to display users(happen on mount)
- evaluate a state Variable (Update)
- clear data functions (unMount)
